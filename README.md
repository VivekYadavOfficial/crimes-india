# Crimes in India Analysis

Crimes in India is the project in which I did the analysis on the time-series crimes dataset. The dataset was obtained from data.world. You can download the data from [here](https://data.world/rajanand/crime-in-india). The dataset contains many csv files. It data is for reported crimes commited in India statewise and regionwise. It contains information on various categories of crimes and the numbers. The data is for the date range 2001-2013. I, first, transformed the data in the same format before I could combine them. Then after combining the data, I did the analysis. I planned to do the prediction for the future using Time-Series forecasting techniques. But, I left it out for now. 
## Thank You.
